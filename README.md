## Simple CRUD Code Example

A simple code that performs CRUD operations, while not fitting into the microservices world, allows for demonstrating what I define as the most important points in a project: Standardization and Organization.

This type of architecture, similar to DDD (Domain-Driven Design), separates the project responsibilities into layers:

- **Domain:** The application domain layer
- **Driven:** The layer that handles all business rules
- **Design:** The presentation layer, in our case, the API
